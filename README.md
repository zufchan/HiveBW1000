# HiveBW1000
This is an analysis of the best 1000 players of the Bedwars gamemode on The Hive Minecraft Java server. Analysis is conducted with Jupyter Notebook using beautifulsoup webscrap, pandas dataframe. The author of the analysis is Idoyatov Zufar, Astana IT University student. All the data was retrieved from The Hive API and NameMC website. Links to those included in the analysis. 

# **IMPORTANT: Since GitHub doesn't support the plotly plots in the Jupyter Notebook directly, download the HTML file for that. Thank you!** 

Apparently GitHub also doesn't support the size of the html file, you could just open it on your PC, so at there is no need for you to install Jupyter Notebook to see the analysis.
