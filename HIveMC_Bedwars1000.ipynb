    "The HiveMC is an official Minecraft Java Edition Server. Minecraft is a sandbox video game developed by Mojang Studios. The game was created by Markus \"Notch\" Persson in the Java programming language and released as a public alpha for personal computers in 2009 before officially releasing in November 2011, with Jens Bergensten taking over development. Currently, Minecraft Java Edition surpasses 30 million lifetime sales. \n",

    "HiveMC or The Hive is a Minigames server owned by Hive Games Limited. It was first registered in 2018. Focuses on providing players with different fun games such as SkyWars, Bedwars, Hide and Seek and DeathRun. Over 12 million unique minecraft accounts visited the server at least once. \n",
    "\n",
    "Bedwars is strategy and player vs. player based minigame where you must protect your bed whilst trying to eliminate your opponents on islands in the sky. You can continue to respawn while your bed is safe. If your bed is destroyed, you can no longer respawn and you are eliminated once you die. Before being first released on multiplayer servers it was a custom game map, developed at 2012, to play with a company of friends. At the time was called as \"Rush\" and was developed by the man named Xisuma. Became very popular once was released on GommeHD, German minigames server, and name was changed to \"Bedwars\". \n",

    "As of 2020, the Bedwars is one of the most popular gamemodes among Minecraft minigames. Average unique player count per day for this gamemode is over 10000 players. I also play bedwars and by this date I'm on 492 place among all 3.6 millions The Hive Bedwars players.\n",

    "We are going to use Beatifulsoup package to get the data from HiveMC API and NameMC. In order to get our data we need to do 5 API requests and scrap from 1000 pages. The algorithm works as following: first we get data of first 200 players  in the top from HiveAPI in form of JSON string and then transformed to object form. Using the Username data we then procceed to first 200 pages of NameMC to scrap the data about the country of the player. Once obtained all of the data will be written to CSV file for further use. Repeat the proccess for the rest 4 API requests. Webscrap took about 4 hours.\n",
